- **Explainability** (SHAP = global patterns + case-level explanations)
- **Fairness testing** (group metrics + disparity interpretation)
into **GDPR-ready documentation** for automated decision systems (Article 22-relevant contexts).

## Evidence → governance question mapping
| Evidence artifact | What it shows | Governance question answered |
|---|---|---|
| SHAP (global) | Main drivers across population | “Can we explain outcomes at model level?” |
| LIME (local) | Why one person got an outcome | “Can we support review/challenge for individuals?” |
| Fairness metrics | Group disparities | “Are outcomes disproportionately adverse?” |
| Audit narrative | limits + safeguards | “What controls reduce risk and enable rights?” |
